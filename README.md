Corruption affects us all. It threatens sustainable economic development, ethical values and justice; it destabilises our society and endangers the rule of law. It undermines the institutions and values of our democracy. But because public policies and public resources are largely beneficial to poor people, it is they who suffer the harmful effects of corruption most grievously.

iReporteraims at minimising corruption through a reporting mechanism. iReporter also helps in tracking issues blocking the efficient regular operations and sees to it that they are solved.
